- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

2. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number:
   - 1 for Addition
   - 2 for Subtraction
   - 3 for Multiplication
   - 4 for Division
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
